                        In the Bay Area Immersion Program, I had the opportunity to take a class by
                        Simon Rogers. The class introduced different data visualization techniques used 
                        in the industry and provided us with hands-on practice. For our final project, Simon
                        wanted us choose a story idea that we could interpret well with data. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As many of my group members were Asian, we quickly honed in on a project that would 
                        look at the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes due to the COVID pandemic. We thought the 
                        numbers (and perhaps lack thereof) would tell a intriguing story that we were curious to uncover.

                    <p>
                        Our first order of business was to locate and decide on datasets that we could use
                        for our project. We soon began to realize that data on reported hate crimes were quite minimal,
                        and the government only shared information from the year prior. Following, due to cultural differences,
                        many victims tend to not report their hate crimes with local government agencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With my journalism background, I suggested we angle our story to focus on media coverage in regards
                        to hate crimes in order for us to use published news stories as a potential dataset. Simon was a 
                        huge help in providing us with a Google News dataset that aggregated all news reports on hate crimes
                        from 2021. The entire dataset had over 7,000 entries, so we split it amongst the five of us and narrowed
                        down the dataset to articles on anti-Asian hate crimes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two of my group members and I tirelessly worked on deciding the various data visualizations we could
                        create with our datasets. One focused on showing the gap between personal experiences (as shown through social
                        media posts), reports to the FBI and news coverage. For this visualization, I created a dataset based on a 
                        previously published interactive by TAAF and mocked up the interactive element once Skye created the graphics. Another
                        visualization compared the number of news articles on randomly selected crimes, which I also created the dataset for and 
                        helped create the visualization on Flourish. We also wanted to perform a sentiment analysis, so I set up a Vader Sentiment Analysis 
                        on Python that I found after looking through various data visualization publications.

                        Overall, I enjoyed searching for and working with datasets, as my group especially needed to
                        make many of our own customizations. In addition, my group initially struggled to find the "story"
                        within the data, so I was challenged to continuously see the big picture and think of 
                        data visualization ideas that would best express our story. I saw firsthand how data can be daunting
                        when provided with large datasets but how effective it can be to provide perspective. My group and I came out 
                        of this project so proud of ourselves, and we went the extra mile of creating a simple webpage to 
                        organize our findings, which I led in the code-front.
