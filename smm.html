                    Social media management has been a key part of my work experience. 
                    During my internship with a local marketing agency, I began working with real brands, such as Ottogi America and A-Sha. 
                    The summer afterwards, I felt confident when I was tasked with managing the various PBS Digital Studios accounts.

                        The summer of my sophomore year, I came across an account of a local marketing agency and 
                        fell in love with the branding and the work they were doing. I decided to take a leap of 
                        faith and apply for an internship, which I was lucky enough to get the offer. Before this 
                        internship, my knowledge of social media was from my personal usage and interest, but I never
                         had the opportunity to manage real accounts. However, at Skoop, I was granted access to the 
                         food manufacturing brands the agency was working with, such as Ottogi America and A-Sha. 
                         Everyday, I used SproutSocial to check and respond to any mentions and comments, a
                         nd developed a structure for the captions on the tri-weekly posts we uploaded per brand. 
                         In addition to writing captions, uploading posts, and engaging with the audience, I 
                         brainstormed and designed posts as needed, such as pitching recipe ideas and developing 
                         moodboards for future photoshoots.

                        At PBS Digital Studios, I initially felt intimidated as the social media accounts had large 
                        followings. Nonetheless, with the help of my manager, I got the hang of utilizing 
                        the PBS brand voice to write captions and develop a content schedule that posted 2-3 times 
                        a week per platform. Despite the number of followers, engagement was often low. To solve this, 
                        I met with social media managers throughout PBS and brainstormed directly with the PBSDS team 
                        while also researching different strategies. As Digital Studios is mostly a hub to distribute and 
                        showcase video series by third-party producers, I realized that it was difficult to develop fresh 
                        content for the Digital Studios platforms. In particular, PBSDS would upload very short GIFs on 
                        Instagram, which I found to be ineffective due to the short length of the videos. Instead, I worked 
                        on creating platform-specific content and encouraging the producers to utilize best practice when 
                        developing social cuts (i.e. creating a square thumbnail, burning in captions). One of my bigger 
                        projects was to develop an interactive, multi-part Instagram story series to promote previously 
                        published video and make better use of the Instagram story function.
