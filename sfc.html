                        For the first few weeks of my internship at the San Francisco Chronicle,
                        I mainly focused on working through a React tutorial to familiarize myself
                        with the language. On top of doing so, my manager, Alex Fong, encouraged me to think 
                        about the stories I'd like to work on during my internship. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I was fresh out of leaving the Bay Area, I thought back to how much I wanted 
                        to go to more Warriors games while I was there and asked Alex if there was an available
                        story about the Warriors. He connected me with the sports designer and editor, who
                        had already been talking about a story that would evaluatethe unique season since the Big 3 players had not
                        played many consecutive games altogether due to injuries. From then on, we scheduled meetings and got to work.

            <h1 class="page-hed">üôÇ process</h1>
            <div class="page-content-container">
                <div class="page-content-text-container">
                    <p>
                        To begin, Alex shared an initial sketch of a wireframe that would have the headshots
                        of the players fade in and out by game. However, I thought there might be too much 
                        content on screen if we had to show all 82 games of the regular season, so I began
                        to ideate on a wireframe that would best display the various combinations of the players 
                        with their general performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I felt that displaying each game would take up too much space on the page and give a more
                        detailed look at the season than we needed. Warner, the sports designer who was also helping
                        with reporting on the story, compiled statistics, with net rating being the most telling 
                        of a combination's performance.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I drew up four different ideas, with two of them being heavily inspired by the rough sketches
                        Alex and Warner had drawn up along with two of my own. After talking with Alex, we discussed using 
                        a scroll effect to pass through player visualizations and datasets. With the wireframe finished, I 
                        used an available SFC template to begin developing the story and implemented code customizations as needed.

                        As it was my first published piece at the Chronicle, there were many confusing 
                        moments along the way. I had to apply what I learned about React very quickly, 
                        and I saw firsthand how the Chronicle used their various content management systems
                        to create their stories. At first, I felt very intimidated and out of my comfort zone, 
                        but I slowly began to enjoy the process and was encouraged that I was finally doing work
                        I was interested in and felt inspired by! It was a great learning experience that showed
                        me there is so much more to learn in the world of digital storytelling.
