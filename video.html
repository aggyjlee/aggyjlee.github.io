                        At the time I took this video course, we were under COVID rules and regulations, and I was one of the few students 
                        who was taking the class remotely. Despite my worries, I took advantage of the stories present 
                        in my hometown, and with the equipment Prof. Duff sent to me, I was able to create entertaining videos.
                    </p>

                        We were tasked with producing two longer-form videos by the middle and end of the quarter. Our first project was to 
                        create an explainer-style video, and after pitching various ideas, I decided to do mine on the urge to reopen the 
                        Disneyland in Anaheim. I shot in-person footage myself at a rally that had taken place the weekend before, created 
                        engaging animations and interviewed key stakeholders for the story. For our final project, I also created a longer 
                        explainer-style video about finding love under COVID conditions. In order to break up the interviews and animations, 
                        I brainstormed ideas for b-roll by creating simple stop motions and filming friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I storyboarded, I went ahead with contacting sources that I found on various social media channels like a Disney 
                        fanpage on Facebook and app developers on TikTok. For b-roll, I created animations on Adobe After Effects after creating 
                        graphics on Adobe Illustrator. While it was quite a labor-intensive project, I was very happy with the video I had produced.

                        Following this class, I looked for more opportunities to produce videos and found it at The Daily Northwestern. Throughout the devo process, I produced 
                        two videos in collaboration with the desk editors. I followed up with creating a video on how prospective students demonstrate
                        interest in Northwestern during COVID. In the spring quarter, I was encouraged to apply for the Video Desk Editor position, which I was 
                        fortunate enough to receive. As a result, I led my own video staff, which I assisted by watching initial cuts, offering feedback on story 
                        flow and suggesting edits. At the same time, I produced stories of my own and edited town halls about the vaccine for the student body.
